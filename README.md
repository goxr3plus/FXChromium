There is a library called [JxBrowser](https://jxbrowser-support.teamdev.com/) which has taken [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) , linked it with Java and created something amazing .

### Warning

I have made also a web-browser entirely in JavaFX , [press here](https://github.com/goxr3plus/JavaFX-Web-Browser).

## What is this repo ?

Based on JxBrowser i have created a completely :

> standalone

> embeddable

> beautiful

> powerful

Web Browser which you can use inside your JavaFX/Swing applications.


This is a futuristic project . I have not yet released the code of it .
